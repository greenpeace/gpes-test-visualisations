## Notes for translators

Translators should click in their .yml language file, edit it and translate. 

Only the expressions inside " and "  should be **translated**. And be careful maintaining the **spaces before each line**, as they provide structure to the  document. Without the correct amount of spaces, the translation will not work.

You can copy-paste and edit the .yml files with a text-editor like [Brackets](http://brackets.io/). It will be **easier to edit long lines** if you enable Word Wrap (in the view menu).

Translators should be able to **preview their translations** directly in their NRO test pages. The preview is available in Github very quickly but it might take a few minutes. Please ask the developer/project coordinator for more information.
