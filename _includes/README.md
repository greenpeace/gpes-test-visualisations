# Visualisations folder

Each subfolder in this folder contains all the html, css, javascript and svg to render a specific visualisation. 

The file all.html contains indications on how the files in the subfolders should be inserted in the pages.

See the examples for more information.

If you are building a multilingual visualisation each translatable expression should be added to the _data folder and linked as in the media-2 example.
